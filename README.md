## About The Project

Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team. The application generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person on the team. Tests are enabled to make the code maintainable. Tests are written for every part of the code to ensure that it passes each test.

The application won't be deployed, but will have a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing.
